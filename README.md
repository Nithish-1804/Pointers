## C++ and Data Structures 
# Pointers

Pointers in C++ are variables that store memory addresses, allowing you to directly access and manipulate data stored in memory. Pointers "point to" or reference the memory location of another object.

## Uses of Pointers
1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**:Pointers are commonly used to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically at runtime. This allows you to manage memory efficiently and avoid wasting resources.
1. **Passing by Reference**:Pointers can be used to pass variables by reference to functions, which enables the function to modify the original value.
1. **Data Structures**:Pointers are essential for implementing complex data structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs.
1. **Array Manipulation**:Pointers can be used to traverse and manipulate arrays efficiently, as they provide direct access to array elements.

## Advantages of Pointers
1. **Dynamic Memory Management**: Pointers enable dynamic memory allocation and deallocation, allowing for efficient use of memory resources.
1. **Passing by Reference**: By passing variables by reference using pointers, you can avoid the overhead of copying large data structures when calling functions.
1. **Data Structures**: Pointers are fundamental for implementing advanced data structures, making it possible to create complex and efficient algorithms.
1. **Array Manipulation**: Pointers provide direct access to array elements, which can lead to more efficient array operations.
1. **Resource Management**: They are crucial for managing and releasing resources like files, network connections, and external hardware.
